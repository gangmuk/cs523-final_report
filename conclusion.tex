\section{Conclusion}

For the best of our knowledge, this is the first failure case study on multi-controller in cluster management system. We found that systems which is managed in distributed manner is highly vulneralble to the multi-controller failures. The 10 cases shown in this paper describe how multi-controller can craft the self-destroying situation which never converges on any good state and sub-optimal status updates which is very likely to confuse the users. We alert users to the fact that multi-controller issues are prevalent in cluster management system and suggest a new layer of verifier to prevent them before it happens.
