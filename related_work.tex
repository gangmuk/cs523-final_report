\paragraph*{Testing}
There exists a long history in testing distributed system. Compared to Sieve~\cite{sieve}, multi-controller have two distinctive differences. First, it is Sieve only focused on a single controller failure. It is not able to test cases multi-controllers are involved. Second, the primary goal of Sieve is to find actual bugs in the system with precise fault injection technique. Multi-controller failure cases presented in this paper are not defined as bug even if it exhibits pathological behavior.
